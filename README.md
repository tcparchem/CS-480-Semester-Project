## Getting Started  
  
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.  
  
### Prerequisites:  
  
What things you need to install the software and how to install them:  
* [Copy of Database]() - Copy of database
  
### Installing:  
  
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment up and running  
  
1. Clone the repo from the following source into a designated folder on your local machine  
	```
	git clone https://tparch3@bitbucket.org/tparch3/trevor_parchem_hw2.git
	```

2. Open up and run IntelliJ. If you're on the welcome screen click "Import Project" otherwise if you have another project open, click "File" > "New" > "Project from Existing Sources... and select the directory named:  
	```
	FirstName_LastName_HW2 
	```

3. 'Import Project' Dialog opens and select 'Import project from external model' and select 'Gradle' then click Finish.
